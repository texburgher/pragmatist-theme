pragmatist-theme
================

The Pragmatist is a responsive Tumblr theme. The easiest way to use The Pragmatist is to install it directly from The Theme Garden. The URL to do that is: http://www.tumblr.com/theme/37021

But you can certainly install it manually by copy/pasting the contents of theme.html here into an empty Custom HTML window in the Customize pane of your tumblog. If you have questions, feel free to contact me. Open an issue here, or email me (texburgher at gmail) or nag me (nicely) on twitter (@texburgher). I do provide support for the theme.
